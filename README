===

Changes from upstream, in no particular order:
- All 1024 byte prefixes (`KB`, `GB`, etc) changed to the correct [SI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units) versions (`KiB`, `GiB`, etc)
- Hide measurements that are close to zero (<0.1% RAM, <0.1% CPU, <1MiB RAM, 0 disk IO, normal process state, <10sec CPU time used)
- Fixed command basename highlighting for executables ran with `wine` and certain processes like `chromium`
- Replaced `no perm` with `N/A` for disk IO
- Add `%` characters after the percentages for `MEM%` and `CPU%` columns
- Truncate usernames to 8 chars and append `\u2026` to them if they're longer than that
- Change spacing in strings to account for some of the above changes

Introduction
------------

This is `htop`, an interactive process viewer.
It requires `ncurses`. It is developed primarily on Linux,
but we also have code for running under FreeBSD and Mac OS X
(help and testing are wanted for these platforms!)

This software has evolved considerably over the years,
and is reasonably complete, but there is always room for improvement.

Comparison between `htop` and classic `top`
-------------------------------------------

* In `htop` you can scroll the list vertically and horizontally
  to see all processes and full command lines.
* In `top` you are subject to a delay for each unassigned
  key you press (especially annoying when multi-key escape
  sequences are triggered by accident).
* `htop` starts faster (`top` seems to collect data for a while
  before displaying anything).
* In `htop` you don't need to type the process number to
  kill a process, in `top` you do.
* In `htop` you don't need to type the process number or
  the priority value to renice a process, in `top` you do.
* In `htop` you can kill multiple processes at once.
* `top` is older, hence, more tested.

Compilation instructions
------------------------

This program is distributed as a standard autotools-based package.
See the [INSTALL](/INSTALL) file for detailed instructions.

When compiling from a [release tarball](https://hisham.hm/htop/releases/), run:

    ./configure && make

For compiling sources downloaded from the Git repository, run:

    ./autogen.sh && ./configure && make

By default `make install` will install into `/usr/local`, for changing
the path use `./configure --prefix=/some/path`.

See the manual page (`man htop`) or the on-line help ('F1' or 'h'
inside `htop`) for a list of supported key commands.

If not all keys work check your curses configuration.
